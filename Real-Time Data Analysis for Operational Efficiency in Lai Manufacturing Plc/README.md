<h1 align="left"> Business Overview/Problem</h1>
<p align="left">
The manufacturing landscape is not without its challenges, and Lai Manufacturing Plc understands the intricacies of optimizing processes, enhancing operational efficiency, proactively addressing issues, and mitigating risks. Their journey has not been without its hurdles, including the need for real-time reporting, ensuring top-notch data performance, and simplifying complex reports. Others include:
  
    A. Production Downtime: The company experiences unexpected equipment breakdowns and maintenance delays, resulting in production downtime and increased costs.
     
    B. Optimizing Processes: The company grapples with the task of streamlining its manufacturing processes, reducing inefficiencies, and eliminating bottlenecks to improve overall productivity.
     
    C. Unmanageable, Unintuitive Reports: The company is burdened with unwieldy and unintuitive reports, hindering decision-making and data-driven initiatives.
     
    D. Inventory Management: Managing raw material inventory levels efficiently is challenging, leading to occasional shortages or overstocking.
     
    E. Supply Chain: Coordination with suppliers and distributors could be improved to reduce lead times and enhance overall supply chain efficiency.

<h1 align="left">Project Rationale </h1>
<p>
Operation Analytics refers to the process of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data from various operational sources within an organization to derive actionable insights and improve overall efficiency. For a complex and multifaceted entity like Lai Manufacturing Plc, where industrial machinery and home appliances are produced, the utilization of Operation Analytics is paramount.

Through Operation Analytics, Lai Manufacturing Plc can gain deep insights into its production processes, detect inefficiencies as they occur, and promptly take corrective measures. This proactive approach not only minimizes downtime but also optimizes resource utilization, resulting in substantial cost savings. Additionally, real-time and intuitive reporting allows for immediate identification of quality control issues, enabling rapid response to maintain the company's reputation for excellence.

Furthermore, the ability to visualize data in real time provides a holistic view of the entire manufacturing ecosystem. This empowers Lai Manufacturing Plc's leadership to make informed decisions, adapt to market trends swiftly, and respond to customer demands with agility. In an era where customer expectations evolve rapidly, the ability to customize production and product lines in real time is a game-changer.

<h1 align="left"> Aim of The Project</h1>
<p>
The primary goal of this project is to harness the power of real-time data analysis to overcome the business challenges and drive operational efficiency and improvements at Lai Manufacturing Plc. The project aims include:

    A. Process Optimization: Implement data-driven process optimization strategies to identify and eliminate bottlenecks and inefficiencies in manufacturing operations.
     
    B. Intuitive Dashboards: Create intuitive and user-friendly data visualization dashboards that empower decision-makers at all levels with actionable insights.
     
    C. Answer crucial questions relating to business using data analysis, such as; Product Performance Analysis (Which products have consistently high production quantities and sales over time?), Quality Metrics Analysis (What is the overall trend in product quality, and has it improved or deteriorated over time?), Supplier Performance Analysis (Which suppliers have the shortest lead times and which ones may need closer monitoring or adjustments in our procurement processes?), Maintenance Analysis (What are the most common types of maintenance activities performed?) Employee Performance Analysis (Which employees consistently achieve the highest performance metrics?) Downtime Events Analysis (What are the most common reasons for downtime events, and can we prioritize efforts to address the most impactful issues?)
