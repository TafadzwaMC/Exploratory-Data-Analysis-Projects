<h1 align="left"> Business Overview/Problem</h1>
<p align="left">
Insight Analytics Solutions has been approached by a Non-Governmental Organization eager to address a critical issue: the escalating criminal activities ostensibly linked to substance abuse. This organization has noted a marked escalation in crimes such as theft, assault, and vandalism, presumed to be connected to drug addiction within their jurisdiction. However, they find themselves without the requisite tools and insights to fully comprehend the dynamics and nuances of this alarming issue. The specific challenges they are encountering include:
 
    A. Lack of Data Integration: The agency collects data from various sources, but there is no centralized system for data integration and analysis.
     
    B. Ineffective Resource Allocation: Limited resources are currently allocated to address drug-related crime, but without accurate insights, resource allocated is suboptimal.
     
    C. Inefficient Reporting: Current reporting methods are  time-consuming and not data-driven, making it challenging to identify trends and patterns.
     
    D. Lack of Predictive capability: The agency lacks the capability to predict and prevent drug-related crimes proactively.

<h1 align="left">Project Rationale </h1>
<p>
To illustrate the nexus between substance abuse and criminal activities, consider the following examples:
     
        A. Drug-Fueled Violence: An increase in violent crimes, such as domestic violence and aggravated assault, can be directly linked to substance abuse. A detailed analysis can reveal the substances involved and the specific demographics affected.
         
        B. Overdose Incidents: Tracking overdose incidents can shed light on the most prevalent drugs in the community and highlight areas in need of addiction treatment and education programs.
         
        C. Gang Involvement: Substance abuse often plays a role in gang-related activities, Analyzing connections between gang members and drug-related offenses can aid in dismantling criminal networks.
         
        D. Drug Trafficking Hotspots: Identifying areas with high drug trafficking activities can help law enforcement agencies allocate resources for interdiction efforts.

<h1 align="left"> Aim of The Project</h1>
<p>
    
    A. Data Integration and validation: Establish robust data integration processes to compile and validate diverse datasets related to substance abuse and criminal activities, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
     
    B. Descriptive Analysis: Perform descriptive data analysis to summarize key statistics and metrics related to drug-related crimes.
     
    C. Frequencies, location trends, and drug types involved.
     
    D. Trend Identification: Identify and document temporal trends in drug-related crimes, such as seasonal variations or long-term increases or decreases, using time-series analysis.
     
    E. Location Analysis: Conduct location-based analysis to pinpoint geographical hotspots of drug-related criminal activities, supporting focused law enforcement efforts.
     
    F. Data Visualization: Develop clear and intuitive data visualizations, such a charts, graphs, using  Excel to present analytical findings for easy interpretation by stakeholders.
